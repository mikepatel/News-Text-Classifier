"The US and the Taliban have signed a ""comprehensive peace agreement"" to end fighting in Afghanistan after more than 18 years of conflict. The US and Nato allies have agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. President Trump said the US was ""working to finally end America's longest war and bring our troops back home"". Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are due to follow. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and leaders of the hardline Islamic movement attended the signing ceremony in Doha in Qatar. Under the agreement, the militants also agreed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control."
"Officials on the US West Coast have reported three unexplained coronavirus cases, raising concerns the virus could be spreading within the community. The patients - in California, Oregon and Washington State - have no known connection to a badly hit country. A total of 59 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in the US, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Meanwhile South Korea, which has the highest number of cases outside China, mobilised the army on Saturday. Soldiers are disinfecting large parts of Daegu, the south-eastern city that has been at the centre of the country's coronavirus outbreak. South Korea on Saturday reported a sharp rise in the number of cases of the Covid-19 disease. It now stands at 3,150. The respiratory illness has killed 17 people in the country so far."
"The Democratic race moves south later on Saturday as voters in South Carolina have their say on who should be the party's White House nominee. We're still a long way off knowing who will take on Donald Trump in the autumn, but after the three contests so far - Iowa, New Hampshire and Nevada - Senator Bernie Sanders leads, trailed by ex-mayor Pete Buttigieg. Former Vice-President Joe Biden is looking at the state - and its African-American voters in particular - as a life raft for his floundering campaign. Whoever wins will gain both delegates and crucial momentum into the spring. Here's what to look out for in the next leg of the 2020 election. "
"Several actresses have walked out of the César awards ceremony in Paris after Roman Polanski, who was convicted of the statutory rape of a 13 year old in 1977, won best director. The awards - France's equivalent of the Oscars - have been mired in controversy after Polanski's An Officer and a Spy received 12 nominations. The Polish-French director fled the US after his rape conviction in the 1970s. He has since faced other accusations of sexual assault. An Officer and a Spy, or J'accuse in French, is about the Dreyfus affair in 19th Century France and won a total of three awards on Friday night. Polanski and members of his crew did not attend the event, with the director having said previously that he feared for his safety. The prize for best film was awarded to Les Misérables by director Ladj Ly."
"After all the slick presentations, after David Beckham has swept in and charmed the 40th floor of a Manhattan hotel, it is hard to believe that, not so long ago, Major League Soccer came close to falling apart. That Beckham - or Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Wayne Rooney, Kaka, Andrea Pirlo, Thierry Henry and Steven Gerrard - might never have come as players. That there might have been no Seattle Sounders, Atlanta United or Inter Miami - the team Beckham now represents as owner. MLS was celebrating the approach of its 25th season this week. Oscar-winning composer Hans Zimmer has created a new anthem to mark the anniversary. However, in 2001, it was ""on the brink"" of collapse, recalls MLS commissioner Don Garber."
"March sees the release of Onward and the Mulan reboot, as well as Hirokazu Kore-Eda’s French-language debut, The Truth. A Quiet Place was one of the most commercially successful, critically adored and downright terrifying horror movies of recent years. Its devilish premise was that the world had been over-run by sightless alien monsters with hyper-acute hearing, so if you made a sound, they would tear you to pieces a moment later. Never before had cinema audiences been so silent. Two years on, writer-director John Krasinski returns for the sequel, and his real-life wife, Emily Blunt, once again plays a woman who has to stop her children talking, sneezing or dropping their cutlery. When she ventures out of the family’s fortified farmhouse, she discovers that some of her fellow survivors (including Cillian Murphy) are just as menacing as the aliens."
"In 2015, the boss of a card payments company in Seattle introduced a $70,000 minimum salary for all of his 120 staff - and personally took a pay cut of $1m. Five years later he's still on the minimum salary, and says the gamble has paid off. Dan Price was hiking with his friend Valerie in the Cascade mountains that loom majestically over Seattle, when he had an uncomfortable revelation. As they walked, she told him that her life was in chaos, that her landlord had put her monthly rent up by $200 and she was struggling to pay her bills. It made Price angry. Valerie, who he had once dated, had served for 11 years in the military, doing two tours in Iraq, and was now working 50 hours a week in two jobs to make ends meet. ""She is somebody for whom service, honour and hard work just defines who she is as a person,"" he says. Even though she was earning around $40,000 a year, in Seattle that wasn't enough to afford a decent home. He was angry that the world had become such an unequal place. And suddenly it struck him that he was part of the problem."
